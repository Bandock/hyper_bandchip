# HyperCHIP-64 Extension

This extension builds upon the foundations of CHIP-8 and SuperCHIP (V1.0/V1.1).  It also has some support for instructions from CHIP-8E and XO-CHIP by John Earnest.

Main purpose behind this extension is to not only enable full access to the 16-bit memory range, but also grant capabilities reminiscent to early computers and consoles 
of the 1980s (compared to the 1970s found when CHIP-8 first existed).  That includes the ability to utilize external storage (mimicking battery-backed storage on game
cartridges) for each program and 4 working programmable sound generators (nearly equivalent to the Commodore 64's SID).

Here lies the supported instructions below:

|Instruction |Description |Extension Inherited From |

Currently Work-In-Progress.
